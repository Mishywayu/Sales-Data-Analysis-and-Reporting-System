# Sales Data Analysis and Reporting System

## Project Overview

The **Sales Data Analysis and Reporting System** is an automated Python-based project designed to extract sales data from a MySQL database, process it, and generate an Excel report with key metrics such as total sales, sales by region, sales trends, and product performance. The system streamlines the process of generating regular sales reports, making it ideal for businesses looking to automate their reporting tasks.

## Features

- **Database Setup**: Includes a sample MySQL database with tables for sales regions, customers, products, and orders.
- **Data Extraction**: Automatically fetches sales data using SQL queries.
- **Data Processing**: Aggregates and processes data to generate useful insights.
- **Excel Report**: Exports the processed data into an Excel file with multiple sheets:
  - Sales by Region
  - Sales Trends (monthly)
  - Product Performance
  - Sales Summary

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Automation of data extraction and report generation.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing sales data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and exporting to Excel.
- **OpenPyXL**: For working with Excel files.
- **SQL**: For querying and extracting data from the database.

## Usage

- The script can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) using a task scheduler (e.g., cron for Linux or Task Scheduler for Windows).
- The generated Excel report can be used by business analysts or managers to review sales performance and make data-driven decisions.
